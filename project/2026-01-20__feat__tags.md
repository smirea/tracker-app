# Task
Implement tags feature for interactions:
- Show list of existing tags (sorted by name)
- Allow creating new tags (typing filters list)
- Tags should be selectable for entries

**Status: COMPLETE**

# Learnings
- Database schema is single source of truth in `db/schema.ts`
- drizzle-orm must be in both places:
  - Root as devDependency for drizzle-kit migrations
  - App as dependency for runtime
- App imports schema via relative path `../../db/schema` - metro bundler resolves to app's drizzle-orm at runtime
- gluestack-ui provides `createInput` creator in `@gluestack-ui/core/input/creator` - followed same pattern as Button component
- Created Input component with variants: outline, underlined, rounded and sizes: sm, md, lg, xl
- TagSelector component features:
  - Search filters existing tags in real-time
  - Creates new tag when typing something that doesn't exist
  - Shows selected tags as removable chips
  - Lists all/filtered tags sorted alphabetically
- useTags hook manages tag CRUD with drizzle-orm and local state for reactivity
- App bundled successfully (expo export verified)
